        <h2>Cocaine, in any form, is a powerfully addictive drug,
            <br> and addiction seems to develop more quickly when the drug is smoked—as
            <br> crack is—than snorted—as powdered cocaine typically is.
            <br>In addition to the usual risks associ- ated with cocaine use (constricted blood vessels;
            <br> increased temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure; and risk of cardiac arrest and seizure),
            <br> crack users may experience acute respiratory problems, including cough- ing, shortness of breath,
            <br> and lung trauma and bleeding. Crack cocaine smoking also can cause aggressive and paranoid behavior.</h2>
