            <h2>Crack cocaine emerged in the early 1980s in the United States.
                <br> Itâ€™s a crystalline form of cocaine that can be smoked,
                <br> providing a quick and intense high. Its origins trace back to cocaine,
                <br> which has been used for centuries.<br>
                 Crack cocaine became popular due to its affordability and potency,
                 <br> particularly in urban areas. Its rise coincided with the crack epidemic,
                 <br> leading to widespread addiction, crime, and social issues.

        <h1><br>&#10042;How is it produced?</h1>
        <p>
            Crack is produced by dissolving powdered cocaine in a mixture of water and ammonia or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda).
            The mixture is boiled until a solid substance forms.
            The solid is removed from the liquid, dried, and then broken into the chunks (rocks) that are sold as crack cocaine.
