        <h2>Cocaine is known to be an expensive recreational drug,
            <br> though its street price can vary quite a bit based on factors like location,
            <br> demand, purity, and more. For the average user, a gram of cocaine might cost $60-$200 in the U.S.,
            <br> making it a relatively pricey habit over time. </h2>
