    <div class="short"><h2>Crack cocaine delivers an intense but short-lived high,
        <br> swiftly followed by profound lows marked by depression, restlessness,
        <br> and an insatiable craving for more. Users often neglect basic needs like eating and sleeping,
        <br> their bodies enduring increased heart rates, muscle spasms, and even convulsions.
        <br> The drug can plunge individuals into a state of paranoia, anger, and anxiety,
        <br> even in moments of sobriety. Regardless of usage frequency or amount,
        <br> crack exponentially heightens the risk of fatal outcomes, from heart attacks to respiratory failure,
        <br> looming as ever-present threats. Smoking crack not only exposes users to toxic fumes from its adulterants but also inflicts physical harm, such as "crack lip," a painful testament to the drug's merciless grip. The descent into addiction is relentless, leaving shattered lives and desperate struggles in its wake, where survival becomes an agonizing battle against the lure of the drug's grasp.</h2></div>
